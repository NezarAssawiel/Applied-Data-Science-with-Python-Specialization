# Applied-Data-Science-with-Python-Specialization

This is an introductory to med level specilization, 5 courses covering the main areas of applied data scinece.
I took it a long while ago; but decided to do it again and earn a certificate for it during April-May 2018 to refresh my info in the areas that I don't deal with often. 

I posted the material after orgnaizing it so someone might find it a useful reference.
